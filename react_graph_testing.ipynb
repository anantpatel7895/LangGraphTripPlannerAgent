They enjoy a hot-wet season and have beautiful architecture and lots of events throughout the year.\\n- Note: September to November, with festival seasons occurring around November. till Feb then it will be hot again in these as well these areas receive very  - pleasant climate from August. Mysore\\'s scenic hills offer the perfect setting with rains through October but at times, and one should expect it to be a pretty sight for the tourists.\\n\\nConsidering all these factors, the choice seems pretty clear it would be the best then to head for, as your city with an array of beautiful locations events, more beautiful hot cold scenic view, less travel fee.\\n\\nBest value for money can be found in the City of Pondicherry. Offering  very  competitive prices and in addition offering  beautiful weather best suitable for some of the festival periods here we all win.\\n\\n```', role='assistant', function_call=None, reasoning=None, tool_calls=None)\n",
